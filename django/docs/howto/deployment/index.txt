Deploying Django
================

Django is full of shortcuts to make Web developers' lives easier, but all
those tools are of no use if you can't easily deploy your sites. Since Django's
inception, ease of deployment has been a major goal.

This section contains guides to the two main ways to deploy Django. WSGI is the
main Python standard for communicating between Web servers and applications,
but it only supports synchronous code.

ASGI is the new, asynchronous-friendly standard that will allow your Django
site to use asynchronous Python features, and asynchronous Django features as
they are developed.
